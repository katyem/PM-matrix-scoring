 generate sjt data

Reverse engineers the data from test score (also generates a correlated performance score) to responses

> - Starts with a vector of random data to represent sjt scores  
> - Creates four section scores from the overall scores. (s1-s4)  
> - Matches response patterns (see the SANDBOX excel file) with section scores for a total of 16 response option values. (s11, s12, s13, s14, s21, s22, s23, s24, s31...)
